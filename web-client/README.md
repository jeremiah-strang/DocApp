# DocApp Web Client

### This is the client-side code for an app that allows users to build a template for a PDF file that would then be filled out via a mobile app. The user can drag and drop various input field types on to the document design surface, and click "mobile preview" to see a preview of what the mobile app would look like when filling the document out.
